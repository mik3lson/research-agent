Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms that can learn from data. By training on datasets, these algorithms identify patterns and relationships, enabling them to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data. The core idea is to allow computers to improve performance on a task without being explicitly programmed for each specific instance. Machine learning encompasses various techniques such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning, and is widely applied in fields ranging from image recognition and natural language processing to recommendation systems and autonomous vehicles.
